# Affective Math Dataset Analysis

This repository contains scripts and documentation for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the physiological signals and associated data from the Affective Math Dataset. The dataset includes data from 30 participants, focusing on four physiological signals, emotional expressions, gaze signals, and questionnaire responses. This project is for COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods in Research.

# Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of Physiological Signals
Q1: Participant-Level Matrix Plot of Raw Signals
Objective: Gain an overview of raw physiological data across participants.
Implementation: Construct matrix plots with each row representing the signal panels of one participant. Include statistical measures of baseline signals for comparison.
Q2: Normalized Signal Matrix
Objective: Normalize physiological signals for consistent analysis.
Implementation: Compute and plot normalized signal matrix.
Q3: Matrix of Summary Statistical Graphs
Objective: Explore differences in signals across tasks (ABSTRACT, WORD, VIDEO).
Implementation: Use boxplots to visualize summary statistics. Accompany with descriptive statistics table.
Q4: Insights from EDA
Objective: Summarize key insights gained from the analysis of physiological signals.

# Step 2: Analysis of Expressed Emotions
1. Momentary Stacked Plots
Objective: Visualize evolution of expressed emotions as time series.
Implementation: Construct participant-level stacked plots.
2. Dominant Emotion Analysis
Objective: Identify dominant emotions and their distribution across tasks.
Implementation: Compute and plot summary proportion plots for emotion labels per task. Include descriptive statistics.
3. Insights from Emotion Analysis
Objective: Discuss insights derived from the analysis of expressed emotions.

# Step 3: Gaze Signals Analysis
1. Participant-Level Matrix of Gaze Signals
Objective: Analyze gaze signals as a four-state variable.
Implementation: Construct matrix of gaze signals across participants.
2. Percentage of Gaze States
Objective: Calculate and visualize percentages of gaze states.
Implementation: Plot summary plot and include descriptive statistics table.
3. Insights from Gaze Signals Analysis
Objective: Present insights derived from the analysis of gaze signals.

# Step 4: Analysis of Questionnaire Responses
1. Summary Plots for SAI and SUS Questionnaires
Objective: Visualize responses from SAI (Situational Awareness Inventory) and SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaires.
Implementation: Construct summary plots for questionnaire responses.
2. Insights from Questionnaire Analysis
Objective: Discuss insights and implications from the questionnaire responses
